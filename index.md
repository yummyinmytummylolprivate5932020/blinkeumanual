## Welcome to Blinkeu's official manual for our Mod Mail bot
Since there are a couple of stages, we ask you to kindly read everything below before doing anything.


### Stage 1 -How it works/what it does.-
Mod Mail is our bot that was made specificly for our server to work to our likings. 
The bot works like this:
An user needs help so he/she/they dm the bot. 
> the bot gets the message and sends it to us back and creates a channel with their name#theirtag.
> You have some choices to do such as replying, ending it etc.
>NOTE: EVERYTHING YOU REPLY/THEY SEND ARE LOGGED AND IF FOUND TO BE USED WRONGLY WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU DURING INVESTIGATIONS<


### Stage 2: How to use the bot

>To reply firstly start your message with: +reply then enter your message after that you want to send. Your message will now be sent to them.
>To close the conversation/end use the following command: +close

### Stage 3: Guidelines
>If the user is spamming/abusing the bot's intentional use, immidentaly do the command +block and they will no longer have access to sending more messages. 
>>>After this please go on bot-logs -> use the command +logs @theirusername#theirtag and an url will be shown, click on that url and screenshot the conversations and send them to @ðŸŒ¸kingpat.

>Abusing the bots intentional use such as blocking people without it being necessary/for no reason will lead to your administration role being removed.

>Anything you send and receive will be logged and used against you if found to be abuse of the services.

>The bot is run by @ðŸŒ¸kingpat and any bot issues/ bugs should only be reported to @ðŸŒ¸kingpat.

>The bot is not an tool and you shouldn't be using it for fun.

>Please contact @ðŸŒ¸kingpat if your wondering about anything, should there be an issue or something you dont understand then please take contact.
